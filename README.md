## About Me

Hello! I'm Michael, a dedicated data scientist based in Guangzhou, China. With a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and multilingual data processing (English, Russian, French, and Chinese), I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. At 32, I bring a blend of technical expertise and a passion for solving real-world problems through data-driven solutions. Explore my projects to see how I leverage Python, SQL, Scikit-learn, and Optuna to deliver impactful results.

## Projects

### [Prologue: Guessing Game](https://github.com/micaelofficial/michaels_mind/blob/main/Project_Zero/game.ipynb)
My first venture into data science, this interactive guessing game demonstrates efficient coding and problem-solving using Python. A great starting point to showcase my early learning journey.

### [Bank Churn Analysis](https://github.com/micaelofficial/michaels_mind/blob/main/PY-13_Final/data.ipynb)
Analyzed bank customer data to identify patterns of churn and proposed data-driven strategies to improve customer retention, utilizing exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling.

### [CVs Exploration](https://github.com/micaelofficial/michaels_mind/blob/main/Project-I_HH/data.ipynb)
Extracted and cleaned data from a leading job-tracking platform, performing in-depth analysis to uncover trends in job postings, candidate profiles, and market dependencies.

### [SQL Data Analysis](https://github.com/micaelofficial/michaels_mind/blob/main/Project-II_HH/data.ipynb)
Leveraged SQL to query and analyze job market data, providing insights into vacancies, employers, and industry trends, with additional research to support strategic decision-making.

### [EDA for Booking.com](https://github.com/micaelofficial/michaels_mind/blob/main/Project-III_Booking/data.ipynb)
Developed a predictive model to detect and address anomalies in hotel review scores on Booking.com, enhancing model accuracy through feature engineering and optimization.

### [ML Classifier](https://github.com/micaelofficial/michaels_mind/blob/main/Project-IV_Classification/Project_4_ML.ipynb)
Built a robust machine learning classifier using Python, Scikit-learn, and Optuna, achieving high predictive accuracy through data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

### [Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/micaelofficial/michaels_mind/blob/main/Project-V_Forecasting/time_series.ipynb)
Designed a time series forecasting model to predict trends in financial data, utilizing ARIMA and Prophet to deliver accurate predictions and actionable insights for stakeholders.
